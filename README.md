## `survey/`

`survey/` contains the LaTeX survey source and build outputs. Build from inside this directory:

```bash
cd survey
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
```

The active bibliography used by the survey lives in `survey/reference.bib`; it currently contains 104 active in-scope entries, and the 正文 cites 102 unique keys with no missing BibTeX definitions. SGX runtime/container background substrate entries that are not cited by the current 正文 live in `survey/background_runtime_reference.bib`; they are retained for historical comparison only and are not active evidence. Metadata-only related-work candidates are kept separately in `survey/candidate_reference.bib`; they must not be cited in 正文 until their metadata, source, and evidence status are verified and promoted into `survey/reference.bib`. Out-of-scope attack-only bibliography entries are preserved separately in `survey/excluded_attack_reference.bib`; it currently contains 64 entries for future attack-scope work and they are not active survey evidence. The P0/P1 subset is controlled by `survey/p0_p1_candidate_status.md`, which assigns all 112 P0/P1 candidates to terminal states: active canonical coverage, explicit backlog/no substantive citation, or background substrate. Current counts and evidence boundaries are reconciled in `survey/evidence_ledger.md`; recent top-conference coverage is audited in `survey/top_conference_coverage_audit.md`, and one-hop expansion decisions are recorded in `survey/citation_expansion_triage.md`.

Evidence classes are defined in `survey/main.tex`: E0 official standards/specs/RFCs, E1 peer-reviewed primary papers, E2 surveys/SoKs, E3 public drafts or not-ratified releases, E4 vendor/industry evidence, and E5 metadata-only/gated/blocked sources.

## `report-slide/`

`report-slide/` contains the LaTeX/Beamer source for the Chinese slide report. It is a presentation layer derived from the taxonomy and evidence matrix in `domain.md`; slide-specific structure should not be copied back into the survey matrix.

Build from inside this directory:

```bash
cd report-slide
make
```

For a stricter local check, run:

```bash
cd report-slide
make check
```

`report-slide/main.pdf` is generated locally for review and is intentionally ignored by Git. `report-slide/slide-example.pdf` is a local visual reference for the desired talk style and is not part of the tracked slide source.

## `reference/`

`reference/` stores the paper library for cited work. The intended layout is:

- `reference/<category>/`: one topic category.
- `reference/<category>/sok/`: fixed directory reserved for SoK papers in that category.
- `reference/<category>/<paper>/paper.pdf`: original PDF when publicly available.
- `reference/<category>/<paper>/README.md`: metadata, source links, download status, and paper-review notes.

See `reference/README.md` for current categories and PDF download status.

## Local Codex Skill

`.codex/skills/reference-paper-review/` defines a repository-local skill for producing deep Chinese reviewer-style analyses of papers under `reference/`.

Typical workflow:

1. Read `reference/<category>/<paper>/README.md`.
2. Use `paper.pdf` when available, otherwise use the source links recorded in the README.
3. Generate the structured paper review described by the skill.
4. Write it back to the paper README with:

```bash
python3 .codex/skills/reference-paper-review/scripts/update_readme.py \
  reference/<category>/<paper>/README.md \
  /path/to/generated-review.md
```

The script updates the `Paper Review` block idempotently using stable markers.
